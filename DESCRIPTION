Description: Help generate slides for surveys or experiments.
 The resulted slides allow the subject to respond with the use of the mouse (usual keyboard input is 
 replaced with clicking on a virtual keyboard on the slide). Subjects' responses are saved to the user-
 specified location in the form of R-readable text file. To allow flexibility, each function in 
 this package generates a particular type of slides thus general R function writing skills are 
 required to compile these edited slides.
